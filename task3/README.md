# Task 3
You've been tasked to design a new bank account page for a client in the banking industry. The frontend team has already created a lo-fi implementation, which uses mock data to display the customer's name, their current bank balance and the total pending charges on their account. Please update their implementation to use real data coming from a backend API!

**The name, balance, and total pending charges of the user should all use live data**

Do **NOT** change the response schema of the backend.


## Running the backend
Run the following commands to run the backend.

```
cd backend
pip install flask
pip install flask-cors
python app.py
```

## Running the frontend

**Note:** You should run the frontend and backend in different terminals

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
             
## Hints
Check out the backend implementation to see what endpoints are available to you. Note the schema, and how it may differ from the mock data you've been given
