# Task 2
You are designing a new course selection service. Right now we are displaying a single card with the name of the course and a button to select it. You have been tasked with adding two key pieces of functionality (please refer to the Figma board for a visual example):

**1. Support Multiple Courses:** Render all of the provided courses as shown in the figma, rather than just the first

**2. Selection:** Users should be able to select a course by clicking the "Select" button. This should add a border of any color around the selected element to highlight it! Clicking again should un-highlight the element. Multiple courses can be highlighted at once

## Running the app
First, confirm you have installed the latest version of node.

Then, navigate to the root of task1, and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
